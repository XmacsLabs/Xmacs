# Xmacs
Xmacs is a fork of GNU TeXmacs:
+ based on a certain release of GNU TeXmacs
+ bug fixes are backported
+ using Qt 5 (since v2020.4)
+ shipped with additional plugins
  - quiver (since v2020.4)

Xmacs is released every three months in 2020. Xmacs v2020.1 is the first release.

There are two releases (v2021.1 in August/v2021.2 in December) scheduled in 2021.

## Roadmap
In 2021, focus on improving performance and Qt 5 integration.

In 2022, start to make Xmacs as a structured editor for code and lightweight markup language.
